Our Branching strategy is the traditional procedure in an agile environment which is git-flow. 

Every time an update/patch is required, a new branch is created for development and for only that sole purpose. After careful testing, the branch will be merged to the dev branch. The git-flow method includes many branches for various purposes. We use the develop branch as our main working branch for the duration of each iteration and any updates for developing features or performing hotfixes will be on a new branch until completed, at which point it is merged back to dev. It adds flexibility since it simplifies parallel processings and allows development to continue by isolating to a mini-branch. Dev branch is almost a “pre-production” master branch. The longevity of a mini development branch is the duration it takes until an individual has declared his/her task complete and it can be merged to the dev branch. On our due date, dev will be merged to master. This ensures the master code branch remains very clean and organized, and is updated only with the dev branch which has been thoroughly tested and refined.
