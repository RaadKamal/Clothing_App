Iteration 1 Worksheet
=====================

Adding a feature
-----------------

Tell the story of how one of your features was added to the project.
Provide links to the feature, user stories, and merge requests (if used), associated tests, and merge commit that was used complete the feature.

Use one or two paragraphs which can have point-form within them.

Exceptional code
----------------

Provide a link to a test of exceptional code. In a few sentences, provide an explanation of why the exception is handled or thrown in the code you are testing.

Branching
----------

Here is our branching strategy:

We can see an example of our branching strategy above. The light blue line shows the addition of a unit test.

Agile Planning
--------------

We planned to have the cart feature for this iteration, however due to time constraints, we ended up pushing it back to iteration 2.

Here is a link to the cart issue:
https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a03/group8/-/issues/2

We made some changes for the user story (#11 , #19). User story #11 and #19 had same issue so we closed issue #19.

Here is a link to the issue #19 :
https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/3350-winter-2021-a03/group8/-/issues/11

The end goal is still the same but setting up and adding the foundation took longer than expected.
