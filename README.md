The mobile clothing app framework is a template for clients to easily set up an online clothing shop. The framework will provide a general layout along with some useful features which will create a fully functional shop once the client enters their shop’s inventory.

Our stakeholders are small business owners and event planners, which may lack adequate resources to develop their own specialized app, but could afford a template license. The framework's significant features provided include sorting items, item reviews, payment systems, and account creation. 

Central to the app is its primary feature, the shop. Customers navigate the store from either the shop front which shows featured products or by clicking the search button which lets them search and filter for their desired item. Features specific to the app’s role as a clothing store are the ability to search by size/materials. If the customer has set their clothes fittings in their settings, fast purchase is enabled. By holding their thumb on the product for a few seconds, the product is added to their cart.

On the product page, customers will have a broad view of an item when purchasing by providing them detailed information on a product in three core categories which are (but not limited to) review, feedback, and the material used to create the item. Customers can mark reviews as “helpful”, with the most helpful reviews appearing at the top of the review panel along with their own reviews.

The cart feature lets customers track pre-purchased items and lets them make changes to the cart. Customers can add/remove items and change the number of items purchased. Customers can see their subtotal/total and type in any discounts they may have. 

Payment is integrated via Square’s In App Payment system to enable digital payment options. Square provides services for generating orders to be completed and refunds using a variety of payment methods, including credit card, gift card and Apple Pay. While Square has an online purchase limit of $50,000, the expected order price for most customers is well below that limit. In return for use of its payment system, Square charges a basic fee of 2.9% + 30¢  on all online transactions. Overhead costs for storage and payment handling would be absorbed as a fee the client pays to use the framework. Included in the cost is product support and maintenance.

The customer settings page allows for standard account controls. After they create an account, they can change their email and password, or search their order history. In addition, customers can manage clothes fittings in their settings, which will be used as a default filter for fitted items. A section for support tickets enables customers to get in contact directly with a business representative to resolve any issues that may arise during their experience, such as receiving wrong items for a full-refund.

The app will be considered a success if it returns a profit within three to four years, accounting for yearly revenue exceeding maintenance and storage costs.
