        <p> <b>Q: How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) vision or stories, or did it work out as predicted?</b>
            <br><br>
	          A: During the development process, there were a few changes to the overall vision of the project. Some due to time constraints, we underestimated the development 
            time of some features which caused a significant backlog during the earlier iterations. This meant fewer features got pushed out than originally desired. The original 
            scope of the project may have been a little too large, but at the end of the day, we ended up with a great product.</p>
        <p> <b>Q: What took the most time? The least? Any surprises?</b>
            <br><br>
	          A: The part of development that was the biggest thorn in our sides was undoubtedly  the database. During iteration 2, we were tasked with setting up an HSQL database 
            and linking to it. Despite it being fairly straight forward on paper, a working database eluded us for the better part of 3 days.
            <br>
	          Conversely, the part that took the least amount of time was setting up the domain objects. This didn't come as a shock to anyone. Even before the class began, we were 
            all well versed in Java and object oriented programming so the implementation details did not take long to conceptualize and develop.
</p>
        <p> <b>Q: What would you do differently, if you had the chance to start over?</b>
            <br><br>
            A: If we had the chance to go back to the beginning of the semester, one thing we would change would be our initial planning process. With a better idea of how much 
            work goes in to developing features, we would be more conservative with the scope of the original idea. By setting more realistic goals, we wouldn't always be playing 
            catch up and rushing features so they get pushed in the iteration, only to spend more time "de-smelling" and refactoring it later. This created a vicious cycle that 
            stayed with us throughout the project and was the cause of many late nights and headaches.</p>
