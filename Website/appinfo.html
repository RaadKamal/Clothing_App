            Picture This:
          </h2>
          <p> You're a small business owner with a great idea for a new clothing brand. You spend many long nights and countless dollars designing and fabricating your 
            awesome new products in your garage or basement. You buy a nice shop in a good location to setup your business. Finally you complete the first dozen batches of clothing and 
            your shop is stocked. Your hard work will soon be rewarded. It is at this moment you remember: it's 2021 and there's a lockdown. No one can come to your store. What do you do 
            now? You already used your child's college fund during the setup process, so you can't afford a software developer.
            <br><br>
            Look no further. With our Mobile Clothing App Framework®, the luxury of a personalized app is within reach. Our framework cuts out the need for the middleman, you can setup your 
            shop without the need of a software developer (they're overpaid anyways). With our easy to use app, all you need to do is add any items you are trying to sell and boom, they will 
            now be visible and available for purchase to the 2.7 billion people that own smartphones (or just to the people who download your app, whichever is lower).
            <br><br>
            After setup, our app will allow customers to browse your entire stock and purchase items using Square's In App Payment system. Any customer who places an order will be required 
            to enter all the information necessary to ship their products. It really is as easy as that. You enter your stock, the app does the rest. Over 100 satisfied customers* can't be 
            wrong, Try our framework today!

            App Overview
          </h2>
          <p> The mobile clothing app framework is a template for clients to assist in the creation of an online clothing shop. Some small business owners lack the means to develop their 
            own functioning app, and so our app provides them with the option to get a license to make their products available online.
            <br><br>
              The app will allow customers to browse a through a list of products provided by the shop owner. After selecting what they want, the customer can proceed to the checkout. 
              They will be asked to give information necessary for shipping such as: name, address, phone number and email. This information will be used in case there is a problem with 
              the order. The store owner will be able to contact the customer and vice versa.
              <br><br>
              Payment is integrated via Square’s In App Payment system to enable digital payment options. Square provides services for generating orders to be completed and refunds using a 
              variety of payment methods, including credit card, gift card and Apple Pay. While Square has an online purchase limit of $50,000, the expected order price for most customers 
              is well below that limit. In return for use of its payment system, Square charges a basic fee of 2.9% + 30¢ on all online transactions. Overhead costs for storage and payment 
              handling would be absorbed as a fee the client pays to use the framework. Included in the cost is product support and maintenance.
              <br><br>
              The team members include Darcy Lawrence, Sangmin Lee, Mostafa Raad and myself, Tripp Wylde. Darcy developed a much better understanding of test driven development, 
              including the workflow from unit tests to acceptance tests. He also  Mostafa dedicated a lot of his time to writing the tests at each stage. He was adept in JUnit 
              and now has a much clearer understanding of the differences between unit, integration and acceptance tests. Sangmin learned a lot about git, which will be essential 
              once in the industry. Also, he is now much more comfortable with the agile development workflow. Finally, I gained valuable experience on working with the android 
              studio ide and common android specific libraries. With mobile devices becoming a larger and larger part of everyday life, I am definitely looking forward to utilizing 
              this knowledge in the future. Additionally, while it's not really coding related, I believe the project management process we underwent on gitlab is extremely helpful 
              in not just a professional environment, but also for personal projects.</p>
